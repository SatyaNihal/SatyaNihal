## 💬 What Colleagues Say About Me
Tomasz Bąk, PhD (Colleague, Nanoprecise): *"I had the pleasure of working with Nihal during his AI internship, where he made a strong impact by contributing to our MCP server, building a basic AI agent, and working on RAG optimization. He even designed a custom scoring system that combined similarity, importance, and recency factors to significantly improve retrieval quality.
